# Pandas Tutorial Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks that I made following the [Pandas tutorial series by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS). It covers the first 9 videos of the series. The content belongs to Corey, I turned it into Jupyter Notebooks.

The dataset used in the notebooks is the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey (2019)](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2019.zip).

My primary goal for mmaking these was to learn Pandas myself. Secondary goals were: improving my explanation style and providing easy-to-follow guides that may save someone time in the future.
